KRUEGER\n\n\u2018We establish that season of birth is related to educational attainment because of school start age policy and compulsory school attendance laws. Individuals born in the beginning of the year start school at an older age, and can therefore drop out after completing less schooling than individuals born near the end of the year. Roughly 25 percent of potential dropouts remain in school because of compulsory schooling laws. We estimate the impact of compulsory schooling on earnings by using quarter of birth as an instrument for education. The instrumental variables estimate of the return to education is close to the ordinary least squares estimate, suggesting that there is little bias in conventional estimates."

    "text": "Every developed country in the world has a compulsory schooling requirement, yet little is known about the effect these laws have on educational attainment and earnings. This paper exploits an unusual natural experiment to estimate the impact of compulsory schooling laws in the United States. The experiment stems from the fact that children born in different months of the year start school at different ages, while compulsory schooling laws generally require students to remain in school until their sixteenth or seventeenth birthday. In effect, the interaction of school-entry requirements and compulsory schooling laws compel students born"

Because one\u2019s birthday is unlikely to be correlated with personal attributes other than age at school entry, season of birth generates exogenous variation in education that can be used to estimate the impact of compulsory schooling on education and earnings."

    "text": "In the next section we present an analysis of data from three decennial Censuses that establishes that season of birth is indeed related to educational attainment. Remarkably, in virtually all of the birth cohorts that we have examined, children born in the first quarter of the year have a slightly lower average level of education than children born later in the year. School districts typically require a student to have turned age six by January 1 of the year in which he or she enters school (see HEW [1959]). Therefore, students born earlier in the year enter school at an older age and attain the legal dropout age at an earlier point in their educational careers than students born later in the year. If the fraction of students who want to drop out prior to the legal dropout age is independent of season of birth, then the observed seasonal pattern in education is consistent with the view that compulsory schooling constrains some students born later in the year to stay in school longer."

    "text": "Two additional pieces of evidence link the seasonal pattern in education to the combined effect of age at school entry and compulsory schooling laws. First, the seasonal pattern in education is not evident in college graduation rates, nor is it evident in graduate school completion rates. Because compulsory schooling laws do not compel individuals to attend school beyond high school, this evidence supports our hypothesis that the relationship be- tween years of schooling and date of birth is entirely due to compulsory schooling laws. Second, in comparing enrollment rates of fifteen- and sixteen-year olds in states that have an age sixteen schooling requirement with enrollment rates in states that have an age seventeen schooling requirement, we find a greater decline in the enrollment of sixteen-year olds in states that permit sixteen- year olds to leave school than in states that compel sixteen-year olds to attend school."

In Section II we consider whether students who attend school longer because of compulsory schooling receive higher earnings as a result of their increased schooling.\n\nTHE EFFECTS OF COMPULSORY SCHOOL ATTENDANCE\n\n981\n\nTwo-stage least squares (TSLS) estimates are used in which the source of identification is variation in education that results solely from differences in season of birth\u2014which, in turn, results from the effect of compulsory schooling laws. The results suggest that men who are forced to attend school by compulsory schooling laws earn higher wages as a result of their increased schooling. The estimated monetary return to an additional year of schooling for those who are compelled to attend school by compulsory schooling laws is about 7.5 percent, which is hardly different from the ordinary-least-squares (OLS) estimate of the return to education for all male workers."

    "text": "To check further whether the estimated schooling-earnings relationship is truly a result of compulsory schooling, we explore the relationship between earnings and season of birth for the subsample of college graduates. Because these individuals were not constrained by compulsory schooling requirements, they form a natural control group to test whether season of birth affects earnings for reasons other than compulsory schooling. The results of this exploration suggest that there is no relationship between earnings and season of birth for men who are not constrained by compulsory schooling. This strengthens our interpretation that the TSLS estimate of the return to education reflects the effect of compulsory school attendance."

Economists have devoted a great deal of attention to correcting for bias in the return to education due to omitted ability and other factors that are positively correlated with both education and earnings. This type of a bias would occur, for example, in Spence\u2019s [1973] signaling model, where workers with high innate ability are assumed to find school less difficult and to obtain more schooling to signal their high ability. In contrast to this prediction, estimates based on season of birth indicate that, if anything, conventional OLS estimates are biased slightly downward.\n\n1.

    "text": "Students who are born early in the calendar year are typically older when they enter school than children born late in the year. For example, our tabulation of the 1960 Census (the earliest census that contains quarter of birth), shows that, on average, boys born in the first quarter of the year enter first grade when they are 6.45 years old, whereas boys born in the fourth quarter of the year enter first grade when they are 6.07 years old.\u201d This pattern arises because most school districts do not admit students to first grade unless they will attain age six by January 1 of the academic year in which they enter school. Consequently, students who were born in the beginning of the year are older when they start school than students who were born near the end of the year. Because children born in the first quarter of the year enter school at an older age, they attain the legal dropout age after having attended school for a shorter period of time than those born near the end of the year. Hence, if a fixed fraction of students is constrained by the compulsory attendance law, those born in the beginning of the year will have less schooling, on average, than those born near the end of the"

The results for 1960 are striking. In states where sixteen-year olds are permitted to drop out of school, the percent of students enrolled is 4.5 points lower for students who have turned age sixteen than for those who are almost age sixteen (see row 3). In contrast, there is only a statistically insignificant 0.6 percentage point decline in the enrollment rate between age fifteen and sixteen in states where students must wait until age seventeen or eighteen to drop out."

    "text": "Although the fraction of students kept in school by compulsory education laws may seem small relative to the total population of students, the estimate represents a nontrivial fraction of the pool of students who eventually drop out of high school. In 1960 about 12 percent of sixteen-year-old students had dropped out of school in states where they were permitted to do so. Therefore, our estimates imply that in 1960 compulsory attendance laws kept approximately one third of potential dropouts in school. By 1980 only 5 percent of sixteen-year olds had dropped out of school, so our estimates imply that compulsory schooling laws kept roughly 10 percent of potential dropouts in school in that year.\n\nThe waning effect of compulsory schooling may result from an increase in desired levels of education for more recent cohorts, which makes compulsory schooling less of a constraint, or from increasingly lax enforcement of compulsory schooling laws. In either case the declining effect of compulsory schooling laws is consistent with the smaller seasonal pattern in education for recent cohorts.\n\nB. Why Do Compulsory Schooling Laws Work?"

This statistic is calculated as the sample size times the R from a regression of the residuals from the TSLS equation on the exogenous variables and instruments [Newey, 1985]. In spite of the huge sample sizes, the overidentifying restrictions are not rejected in the models in Tables IV and V. The models in Table VI lead to a rejection of the overidentifying restrictions, but the models that include a quadratic age trend are close to not rejecting at the 0.01 level."

For example, the TSLS estimate in column (6) of Table VII is 0.083 with a standard error of 0.010, and the OLS estimate is 0.063 with a standard error of 0.0003: the TSLS estimate is nearly 30 percent greater than the OLS estimate."

For example, the OLS estimate of the return to education for men born 1930-1939 with nine to twelve years of education is 0.059, compared with 0.063 for the full sample in column (5) of Table V. We also note that we obtained similar TSLS estimates of the return to education when our extracts were restricted to men with a high school degree or less.\n\nC. Estimates for Black Men\n\nUsing data on men born in the first half of the twentieth century, many researchers find that OLS estimates of the return to education are lower for black men than for white men (e.g., Welch [1973] ). At least part of the lower return to education for black men appears to be due to the lower quality schools that were provided for black students in these cohorts (see Card and Krueger [1992b] ). If schools attended by black students were of inferior quality, then we would expect to find a lower return to compulsory schooling for black workers than for white workers."

As in Table VII the excluded instruments for education are interactions between quar- ter-of-birth and year-of-birth dummies, and interactions between quarter-of-birth and state-of-birth dummies. Both the OLS and TSLS estimates indicate that the return to education is lower for black men than for the entire male population. In view of the lower quality of schools attended by black students, this finding provides some additional support for the plausibility of the TSLS estimates.

From Section I it would seem that season of birth is related to education because of compulsory schooling requirements. However, for the TSLS esti- mates to be consistent, it must also be the case that season of birth is uncorrelated with the residual in the earnings equation (p). In other words, if season of birth influences earnings for reasons other than compulsory schooling, our approach is called into question. Although we believe the evidence in Section I establishes that season of birth influences education exclusively because of compulsory schooling, it is useful to consider the impact of other possible effects of season of birth."

Furthermore, much of the past literature fails to adequately control for the effects of age.\u201d Nevertheless, the previous research indicates that there might be a relationship between age at school entry and academic performance. The consensus in this literature is that, if anything, students who start school at an older age are more mature and perform better in school."

Assume, for the moment, that children born in the beginning of the year are better students because they are older than their classmates. Men born in the first quarter of the year would therefore have greater unob- served ability for a given level of schooling. However, men born in the first quarter also have less education, probably due to the dominant effect of compulsory education laws. Assuming that this unobserved ability is rewarded in the labor market, any estimator of the return to education that is identified by variations in education due to season of birth would be biased downward.\n\nSecond, we note that if season of birth were related to the socioeconomic status of children\u2019s parents, one might expect to find a connection between season of birth and education.

Lam and Miron [1987], however, present a variety of evidence suggesting that season of birth is unrelated to the socioeconomic status (and other characteristics) of parents. For example, they find that the seasonal pattern in births is virtually identical for illegitimate births and legitimate births. In addition, they find that the seasonal pattern of birth is similar across urban and rural families, across regions of the United States that have diverse economic and cultural conditions, and within countries before and after dramatic economic transitions."

There is no obvious reason why the psychological or socioeconomic explana- tions for the seasonal pattern of education would have less force for the 1940s cohort than for the 1920s cohort. On the other hand, if season of birth influences education because of compulsory school- ing, one would expect to find a smaller effect for individuals in more recent cohorts, who are likely to be less constrained by the compulsory schooling requirement."

    "text": "Finally, and perhaps most convincing, we have estimated the effect of season of birth on the earnings of college graduates, a sample whose schooling was not prolonged by compulsory atten- dance. If season of birth affects education for a reason other than compulsory schooling (e.g., psychological effects of school start age), we would expect season of birth to be related to earnings for this sample. On the other hand, if season of birth only affects education and earnings because of compulsory schooling, we would not expect any relationship in this sample. The estimates suggest that quarter of birth has no effect on earnings for college gradu- ates, a finding which supports the estimation framework employed\n\nTHE EFFECTS OF COMPULSORY SCHOOL ATTENDANCE"

For example, using the sample of 40-49-year- old college graduates in the 1970 Census, an F-test of the joint significance of quarter-of-birth dummies in an earnings regression that includes year-of-birth dummies is not rejected at the 25 percent level. Similar results hold for 40-49-year-old men in 1980. We take this as strong evidence that, in the absence of compulsory schooling, season of birth would have no effect on earnings.\n\n1009\n\nIV.

    "text": "Differences in season of birth create a natural experiment that we use to study the effect of compulsory school attendance on schooling and earnings. Because individuals born in the beginning of the year usually start school at an older age than that of their classmates, they are allowed to drop out of school after attaining less education. Our exploration of the relationship between quarter of birth and educational attainment suggests that season of birth has a small effect on the level of education men ultimately attain. To support the contention that this is a consequence of compulsory schooling laws, we have assembled evidence showing that some students leave school as soon as they attain the legal dropout age, and that season of birth has no effect on postsecondary years of schooling."

    "text": "Variation in education that is related to season of birth arises because some individuals, by accident of date of birth, are forced to attend school longer than others because of compulsory schooling. Using season of birth as an instrument for education in an earnings equation, we find a remarkable similarity between the OLS and the TSLS estimates of the monetary return to education. Differences between the OLS and the TSLS estimates are typically not statistically significant, and whatever differences that do exist tend to suggest that omitted variables, or measurement error in education, may induce a downward bias in the OLS estimate of the return to education.\u201d This evidence casts doubt on the importance"

    "text": "Our results provide support for the view that students who are compelled to attend school longer by compulsory schooling laws earn higher wages as a result of their extra schooling. Moreover, we find that compulsory schooling laws are effective in compelling some students to attend school. Do these results mean that compulsory schooling laws are necessarily beneficial? A complete answer to this question would require additional research on the social and private costs of compulsory school attendance. For example, compulsory attendance may have the benefit of reducing crime rates. And they may impose a social cost because students who are compelled to attend school may interfere with the learning of other students.\n\nAPPENDIX 1: DATA"
