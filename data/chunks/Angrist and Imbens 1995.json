    "text": "Two-Stage Least Squares Estimation of Average Causal Effects in Models With Variable Treatment Intensity\n\nJoshua D. ANGRIST and Guido W. IMBENS*\n\nTwo-stage least squares (TSLS) is widely used in econometrics to estimate parameters in systems of linear simultaneous equations and to solve problems of omitted-var.ables bias in single-equation estimation. We show here that TSLS can also be used to estimate the average causal effect of variable treatments such as drug dosage, hours of exam preparation, cigarette smoking, and years of schooling. The average causal effect in which we are interested is a conditional expectation of the difference between the outcomes of the treated and what these outcomes would have been in the absence of treatment. Given mild regularity assumptions, the limit of TSLS is a weighted average of per-unit average causal effects along the length of an appropriately defined causal probability response function. The weighting function is illustrated in an empirical example based on the relationship between schooling and earnings.\n\nKEY WORDS: Instrumental variables; Rubin causal model; Schooling; Wages.\n\n1.

    "text": "Evaluation research in econometrics and applications of IV and TSLS in other fields typically rely on regression mod- els with constant coefficients. The regression approach to evaluation postulates a hypothetical linear response function. In contrast, the statistical literature on evaluation has been strongly influenced by Rubin's (1974, 1977) model for causal inference using counterfactual outcomes. (The ideas behind this framework date back to Neyman and Fisher; see Rubin 1990 for historical details.) In a methodological paper related to this one (Imbens and Angrist 1994), we discuss the use of IV to estimate average causal effects in Rubin's causal model for binary treatments, as well as how to estimate the sampling variance of IV estimates of treatment effects. In another recent paper (Angrist, Imbens, and Rubin 1995), we present a detailed analysis of the conceptual issues and problems that arise when IV is used to estimate the average causal effect of a binary treatment in the Rubin causal model, together with a survey of evaluation research in econometrics and statistics."

    "text": "Econometricians and statisticians have developed a variety of techniques for the estimation of systems of linear simul- taneous equations. The simplest and most commonly used of these techniques is the class of instrumental variables (IV) estimators, of which two-stage least squares (TSLS) is the most important special case. IV and TSLS were developed in early research on simultaneous equations estimation (by Wright [1928] and Theil [1958], among others), and both estimators are now described in every econometrics textbook (e.g., Theil 1971). These techniques are typically introduced as solutions to the problem of \"simultaneous equations bias.\" More generally, however, IV provides a powerful and flexible estimation strategy that can be used to tackle the problem of omitted-variables bias in a wide range of single-equation regression applications, such as models with mismeasured regressors (Durbin 1954) and the estimation of treatment effects in manpower training programs (Heckman and Hotz 1989; Heckman and Robb 1985)."

This induces a relationship between quarter of birth and educa- tional attainment, because students born in the first quarter of the year enter school at an older age than do students born in later quarters. Students who enter school at an older age thus are allowed to drop out after having completed less schooling than students who enter school at a younger age. If students' quarter of birth is correlated with earnings solely because it is correlated with schooling, then it is an instru- ment for schooling in an earnings equation."

As an example, calculations underlying Wald estimates based on a first quarter/fourth quarter comparison for men are laid out in Table 1.

APPLICATION: THE EFFECT OF COMPULSORY SCHOOL ATTENDANCE ON EARNINGS\n\nThe theory of human capital (Becker 1964) says that years of schooling can be treated much the same way as an in- vestment in physical capital, yielding a rate of return some- thing like an interest rate. The empirical counterpart of this theory is the \"human capital earnings function,\" a semilog- arithmic regression of earnings on schooling and other co- variates.

Ordinary least squares (OLS) applied to ( 1 ), however, may lead to biased estimates of p even if the true response function is linear. The reason is that schooling is determined by individual choices under constraints. For example, the literature on schooling and earnings has devoted considerable attention to the problem of \"ability bias\" in estimates of the economic return to schooling. This is a form of omitted-variables bias that would arise if more able individuals in the labor market get more schooling, perhaps because of better access to capital markets. The observed positive correlation between schooling and earnings would then partly reflect the fact that those with more schooling have higher earnings potential. In terms of Equations ( 1 ) and (2), ability is common to the error terms, e and q, and so these error terms are correlated."

Ignoring the small sampling error of the OLS estimates, the Wald estimates are within sampling error of the OLS estimates (8% and 7% in the two Census data sets). Thus the instrumental variables estimates seem to support a conclusion that the OLS estimates are not biased by unobserved ability in the error term. (A detailed case for this claim is made in Angrist and Krueger 1991, which also discusses strategies to control for age effects when using quarter of birth as an instrument for schooling.)\n\nThe general formula for an IV estimate is (Z'W) -'Z 'y, where Z is a matrix of instruments conformable to the matrix of regressors, W, with rows including X1 and S, and y is a vector of observations on the dependent variable. Because X1 is assumed to be uncorrelated with e, Z typically includes X1 and a single variable not in X1, perhaps taken from X2 in (2). For example, X2 might include quarter of birth. For IV to be consistent, Z must be asymptotically uncorrelated with the regression error and the probability limit of (Z 'W/ n) must be nonsingular (n is the sample size)."

For example, Permutt and Hebel ( 1989) discussed conditions sufficient to identify the effect of smoking when it is assumed that all that matters for health is whether any cigarettes are smoked. Similarly, econometricians sometimes estimate the effect of college and/or high school graduation on earnings, ignoring the fact that dummy variables indicating graduation are nonlinear functions of an underlying years-of-schooling variable (e.g., Rosen and Willis 1979)."

Just as the simple Wald estimator converges to a weighted average effect along the length of the causal response function, TSLS estimates provide one way of combining a set of different weighted average effects into a new weighted average. The weights used to construct TSLS estimates from Wald estimates are proportional to (E[SI Z = k] - E[SI Z = k- 1]). Thus the better the Wald estimate, in the sense of being based on an instrument with a bigger impact on the regressor, the more weight it receives in the TSLS linear combination. The second component of the weighting function, Jf=k k,r,(E[SI Z = /1] - E[S]), sim- plifies to [E(SI Z 2 k) - E(SI Z < k)]P(Z 2 k)[ 1 - P(Z ? k)].

These results apply to the case discussed here, and they imply that standard errors of the ACR can be calculated using formulas of Huber (1967) and White (1982). One reason for reporting TSLS estimates as well as Wald estimates is that in models with constant treatment effects, the TSLS estimates have asymptotically lower sampling variance than any single Wald estimate. In general, however, this need not be true if there is variation in the average causal response across instruments.

But in the model outlined here, each instru- ment can lead to a different estimate even though all the instruments satisfy the independence assumption.

In the con- text of Theorem 3, the TSLS estimates in columns (4) and (8) can be interpreted as a weighted average of separate TSLS estimates of the ACR for each year of birth.\n\nThe TSLS overidentification test statistics for each of the models reported in Table 2 are far from critical values at levels under the null hypothesis of conventional significance constant treatment effects and instrument error orthogo- nality. Thus the test statistics cast little doubt on the constant- treatment-effect and independence assumptions.\n\n6. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS"

    "text": "This article defines the average causal response to variable treatments such as drug dosage, cigarettes smoked, hours of study, and years of schooling. We have shown here that a weighted average of per-unit causal responses to a change in treatment intensity is identified in a wide variety of models and circumstances. The average response that we can identify is for individuals whose treatment status is affected by an in- strumental variable that is independent of potential outcomes intensities. The monotonicity and potential treatment condition imposed when deriving this result requires only that the in- strumental variable affect treatment intensity in the same di- rection for each unit of observation. This condition has testable implications in models with variable treatment intensities."

    "text": "We have presented formulas for the weighting functions that underlie IV and TSLS estimates of average causal effects. These formulas can help empirical researchers understand which observations are contributing to a particular estimate and provide a causal interpretation for some of the simple estimators commonly used in applied research. The inter- pretation of TSLS and the example presented here serve to emphasize a point made earlier by Rubin (1986), that ob- servational data can only be informative about the causal effect of treatment for those whose treatment status can be thought of as having been manipulated in some way. This paper shows that the estimated treatment effect may change when the nature of this manipulation changes.\n\nAPPENDIX: PROOFS\n\nProof of Theorem I\n\nLet I(A) be the indicator function for the event A. Define the following indicators: Xzj = I(Sz 1 j) for Z = 0, 1 and j = 0, 1, 2, ... . J + 1. Note that Xzo = 1 and Xzj+l = 0 for all Z. In terms of the Xzj, Y can be written as\n\n+ 1 Y = Z * Ysl + ( I-+Z)\n\n441\n\nE Using the independence assumption, E [ Y I Z = 1]E - Z = 0] Y is, therefore,"
