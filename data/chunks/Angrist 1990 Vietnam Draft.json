    "text": "Lifetime Earnings and the Vietnam Era Draft Lottery: Evidence from Social Security Administrative Records\n\nBy JOSHUA D. ANGRIST*\n\nThe randomly assigned risk of induction generated by the draft lottery is used to construct estimates of the effect of veteran status on civilian earnings. These estimates are not biased by the fact that certain types of men are more likely than others to service in the military. Social Security administrative records indicate that in the early 1980s, long after their service in Vietnam was ended, the earnings of white veterans were approximately 15 percent less than the earnings of comparable nonveterans.

    "text": "A central question in the debate over mili- tary manpower policy is whether veterans are adequately compensated for their service. The political process clearly reflects the de- sire to compensate veterans: since World War II, millions of veterans have enjoyed benefits for medical care, education and training, housing, insurance, and job place- ment. Recent legislation provides additional benefits for veterans of the Vietnam era. Yet, academic research has not shown conclu- sively that Vietnam (or other) veterans are worse off economically than nonveterans. Many studies find that Vietnam veterans earn less than nonveterans, but others find posi- tive effects, or effects that vary with age and"

Previ- ous research comparing civilian earnings by veteran status may be biased by the fact that certain types of men are more likely to serve in the armed forces than others. For exam- ple, men with relatively few civilian opportu- nities are probably more likely to enlist. Es- timation strategies that do not control for differences in civilian earnings potential will incorrectly attribute lower civilian earnings of veterans to military service. The research reported here overcomes such statistical problems by using the Vietnam era draft"

    "text": "The empirical analysis begins in Section II with estimates of the effect of draft eligibility on earnings. If draft eligibility is correlated with veteran status but uncorrelated with other variables related to earnings, then earnings differences by draft-eligibility status can be attributed to military service. In Sec- tion III, information on the proportions of draft-eligible and draft-ineligible men who actually served in the military is used to convert estimates of the effect of draft eligi- bility into estimates of the effect of military service. The assumptions underlying this procedure are those that justify instrumental variables estimation; in principle, any func- tion of the RSN provides a legitimate instru- ment for veteran status. In the second part of Section III, an instrumental variables esti- mation strategy is developed which is more efficient than one based solely on draft-eligi- bility status. Results in Section III indicate that white veterans earn approximately 15 percent less than nonveterans as much as ten years after their discharge from the military."

The first researchers to use the lottery to solve the selection problem were Norman Hearst, Tom Newman, and Stephen Hulley (1986), who present lottery-based estimates of delayed effects of military service on mortality.\n\nI. Background and Data\n\nA. National Random Selection3\n\nThere were five draft lotteries during the Vietnam War period. The 1970 lottery cov- ered 19- to 26-year-old men born in 1944-50, although most of the men drafted in 1970 were born in 1950. Other lotteries were re- stricted to 19- and 20-year-olds. The 1971 lottery covered men born in 1951, the 1972 lottery covered men born in 1952, and so on, through 1975. However, no one was drafted after 1972, and congressional conscription authority expired in July 1973."

As a consequence of this delay, many men with low numbers volunteered for the military to avoid being drafted and to improve their terms of service (Angrist 1989b). There was even a behavioral re- sponse to the lottery in enlistment rates for the 1953 cohort, although no one born in 1953 was drafted. In the analysis that fol- lows, the \"draft-eligibility ceiling\" for men born in 1953 is set at RSN 95, the highest lottery number called in 1972.\n\n3This section draws on Curtis Tarr (1981) and the Selective Service System (1986).\n\n4Men born from 1944-49 were already of draft age when the 1970 lottery was held on December 1, 1969. For nonveterans in this group, subsequent liability for service was determined by 1970 lottery numbers.\n\nThis content downloaded from 18.9.61.112 on Tue, 07 Nov 2017 21:08:27 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\n\nVOL. 80 NO. 3"

Subsequent selection from the draft-eligible, nondeferred pool was based on a number of criteria. The most important screening criteria were the pre- induction physical examination and a mental aptitude test. In 1970, for example, half of all registrants failed pre-induction examina- tions and 20 percent of those who passed were eliminated by physical inspections con- ducted at induction (Selective Service Sys- tem, 1971). Of course, the fact that armed forces selection criteria were ultimately not random does not mean that the initial prior- ity for induction was not randomly assigned by RSN."

Angrist (1989c) also reports estimates of the effect of draft eligibility on the probability of having no recorded earnings. These tabu- lations indicate that draft-eligible whites were somewhat more likely to have had FICA earnings during the years in which they were in the service, and that draft-eligible nonwhites are more likely to have had no earnings in recent years.

The sample is re- stricted to the subset of whites born 1950-52 because the results in Table 2 suggest that this is the group for whom draft eligibility is most likely to be a useful instrument. Earn- ings variables are for 1981-84 because the impact of military service in these years rep- resents a long-term effect.

The correction pro- cedure is described in detail in Section 6 of the Appendix. Briefly, data are adjusted for censoring by using the fraction with recorded earnings at the taxable maximum, combined with mean earnings above the taxable maxi- mum estimated from Current Population Surveys, to estimate population mean earn- ings from censored mean earnings. Note that the effects estimated using the adjusted data are usually bracketed by the effects esti- mated using the unadjusted FICA and W-2 data.

These figures show that, with the exception of the 1950 cohort, the SIPP and DMDC/CWHS procedures give reasonably similar estimates of _ - p\". Inaccuracy of the DMDC/ CWHS estimates for 1950 is a consequence of the fact that DMDC administrative records are unavailable before July 1970. Therefore, despite the limitations of the SIPP data, the SIPP must be used to construct probabilities for the 1950 cohort. The SIPP sample is too small to allow estimation of a complete set of p for all lottery number cells in 1950. Consequently, SIPP estimates for 1950 are computed for only two cells, defined by draft-eligibility status, and CWHS earnings data for men born in 1950 are also grouped by draft eligibility. Thus, for each race and year, the sample used to estimate equation (3) includes 73 cell means for each of the three cohorts born from 1951-53, plus two cell means for the 1950 cohort."

Detailed descriptions of the DMDC administrative records may be found in Angrist (1989b). Briefly, the DMDC data show the total num- ber of new entrants to the military by race, cohort, and lottery number from July 1970 through December 1973.\n\nDMDC and CWHS administrative records are used to estimate 1bj by first counting the number of entrants to the military by race, cohort, and lottery number interval.

These results generally are similar in magnitude to the Wald estimates reported in Table 3. Also, as in Table 3, regression estimates for adjusted FICA earnings tend to be bracketed by the results for unadjusted FICA and W-2 earn- ings. Although many of the estimates for individual cohorts in Model 1 are not signif- icant, the combined estimates for whites in Model 2 are substantially larger than twice their standard errors. In contrast, results for nonwhites show no evidence of a statistically significant earnings loss to veterans.\n\nThe overidentification test statistics re- ported in Table 4 take on values less than their degrees of freedom, suggesting that the residuals in equation (1) are not correlated with lottery-based instruments.12 It should be noted, however, that low values of the test statistics may indicate low power in a test with so many degrees of freedom. On the other hand, without a particular alternative hypothesis in mind, it seems natural to re- port the omnibus goodness-of-fit test."

Treatment Effect Heterogeneity\n\nThe effect of veteran status can only be estimated for those who served in the armed forces. If veterans are more or less likely to benefit from military service than the rest of the population, then the estimated veteran status coefficient does not characterize the impact of veteran status on a random sam- ple. This problem is formalized in the ran- dom coefficients model for treatment effect heterogeneity:"

This may be of concern if the impact of veteran status is primarily through its effect on covariates. For example, veterans might have a higher level of educational attainment because of financial aid available through the GI Bill. In the absence of data on education, esti- mated veteran effects confound the \"pure\" effect of military service with its effect on education. Formally, the need for covariates may be represented by replacing at with xiA in (1). In this case, instrumental variables estimates identify\n\na= [E(xilsi =1) -E(xilsi = O)] 8 + a.\n\nIn many applications, however, it may be a that is actually the parameter of interest.

Such correlation will bias estimates of the effects of military service constructed using the lottery. But in a previous study using micro data (Angrist, 1989a), specification tests provided no evidence of a relationship between lottery numbers and characteristics other than veteran status. The overidentifi- cation test statistics reported here also show no evidence of omitted variables bias. Fi- nally, even if having a low lottery number is correlated with a tendency to stay in school, the fact that earnings rise with schooling implies that lottery-based estimates of the effect of veteran status will tend to underes- timate the true effect.\n\nVI.

On the other hand, Mark Berger and Barry Hirsch (1983) find essentially no effect on 1977 weekly earnings, and Angrist (1989a) reports OLS coefficients of zero when using the National Longitudinal Survey (NLS) to estimate the effects of veteran status on hourly wages. In contrast to the OLS esti- mates, lottery-based estimates from the NLS indicate that white veterans had lower hourly wages in 1981 than their nonveteran coun- terparts. Similar results from the SIPP are reported in Angrist (1989c). Thus, lottery- based estimates from a variety of sources provide conclusive evidence that white Viet- nam veterans were disadvantaged by their service.18"

Goodness-of-fit tests sug- gest that for whites, the time-series of vet- eran status coefficients is consistent with this hypothesis. Experience-earnings profiles esti- mated using Social Security data imply that white veterans suffered an earnings reduc- tion equivalent to the loss of two years civil- ian labor market experience."

One of these is the question of alternatives to the loss-of-experience explanation for the reduction in white veterans' earnings. Vet- eran status may be a screening device, as suggested by DeTray (1982), or there may be cohort size effects such as those discussed by Finis Welch (1979). Because the Social Secu- rity data include information on variances, testable implications of these theories might also include restrictions on second, as well as first, moments. Another question for future research is whether draft eligibility affected educational and career plans independently of its effect on military service. The lottery\n\nmay provide a useful tool for research on changing educational attainment in the 1960s and 1970s."

Elsewhere, Alan Krueger and I have argued that the need for reconciliation is, at least in part, illusory (Angrist and Krueger, 1989). Although OLS regressions usually show that the effect of World War II veteran status is large, posi- tive, and significant, these results may actu- ally be a consequence of selection bias. By exploiting the fact that World War II vet- eran status is also correlated with exact date of birth, we have implemented an instrumen- tal variables estimation strategy similar in spirit to the one used here. The results of this procedure indicate that the true impact of World War II veteran status on earnings is no larger than zero and may well be negative.\n\nAPPENDIX: DATA SOURCES AND METHODS\n\n1.

Meyer's fig- ures for state, local, and civilian federal government employees imply that by 1981, roughly 58 percent of all civilian government workers were covered.\n\nFICA taxable maximums are reported in Appendix Table Al. The combined effects of limited coverage and censoring at the taxable maximum are conveniently summarized by the percentage of all earnings that are reported to the SSA.

Draft lottery num- bers were then matched to the dates of birth using lottery number tables in Selective Service System Semi- annual Reports for 1969-73.

To evaluate these figures, note that the author's tabulations show that roughly 10 percent of white men in these cohorts have zero recorded wage and salary earnings in the late 1970s' Current Population Surveys. Suppose that of the 90 percent who work, 12 percent are in the uncovered sector so that only 79 percent of the cohort may be expected to have positive FICA wage and salary earn- ings. Adding an estimated 5 percent who only have FICA self-employment earnings implies that 16 percent should have zero FICA earnings of any type. Thus, 14-18 percent of CWHS earnings being zero for whites between 1973 and 1980 does not seem unreasonable."

For example, the standard deviation of whites' W-2 earnings in 1978 is six times the mean and does not fall below the mean until 1981. Another disturbing feature of the W-2 series is that nominal earnings appear to fall from 1978-80. The W-2 series also has a substantially higher fraction of zeros than the FICA series does.

This procedure is also applied to the adjusted FICA series described in Section 6 of the Appendix, with the modification that adjusted standard errors (diagonal elements of Q) are used to convert correlations to covariances.\n\nThe covariance matrix of p is also block diagonal, with elements equal to the variance of PCj in every element of the block corresponding to the time series for cohort c and lottery cell j. The variance of Pcj is estimated using the standard formula for an estimated proportion. The sample size in the formula is taken to be the size of the SIPP cohort for those born in 1950 and the size of the CWHS cohort for those born from 1951 to 53.\n\n6.

Cohort was determined on the basis of age in 1985; ages 34-35 were assigned 1950, ages 33-34 were assigned 1951, ages 32-33 were assigned 1952, and ages 31-32 were assigned 1953. The CPS reports wage and salary earnings in the year preceding the survey year. To compute the adjusted 1981-84 earnings series used in Tables 3 and 4, data from the CPSs for 1982-85 were used to compute separate a I by cohort and race for each year. Additional details and summary statistics for the CPS data are reported in Appendix A of Angrist (1989c). It should be noted that CPS earnings data are also censored-at $75,000 for 1981-83 earnings and at $100,000 for 1984 earnings.\n\nStandard errors for the adjusted series are calculated as follows. Let m = [m m 'm ]' denote the vector of sample moments corresponding to /,uC p', and gL and let ij ( =i, j=1,2,3) denote the corresponding blocks of the covariance matrix of m.
