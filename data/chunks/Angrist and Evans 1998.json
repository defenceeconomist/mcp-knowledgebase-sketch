    "text": "Children and Their Parents\u2019 Labor Supply: Evidence from Exogenous Variation in Family Size\n\nBy JosHUA D. ANGRIST AND WILLIAM N. EVANS *\n\nResearch on the labor-supply consequences of childbearing is complicated by the endogeneity of fertility. This study uses parental preferences for a mixed sibling-sex composition to construct instrumental variables (1 ) estimates of the effect of childbearing on labor supply. 1V estimates for women are significant but smaller than ordinary least-squares estimates. The IV are also smaller for more educated women and show no impact of family size on husbands\u2019 labor supply. A comparison of estimates using sibling-sex composition and twins instruments implies that the impact of a third child disappears when the child reaches age 13. (JEL J13, J22)"

    "text": "An understanding of the relationship between fertility and labor supply is important for a num- ber of theoretical and practical reasons. First, economists and demographers have developed a variety of models linking the family and the la- bor market. Empirical studies of childbearing and labor supply are sometimes seen as tests of these models (e.g., Reuben Gronau, 1973; Mark R. Rosenzweig and Kenneth 1. Wolpin, 1980b; T. Paul Schultz, 1990). Second, the link be- tween fertility and labor supply might partly ex- plain the postwar increase in women\u2019s labor-force participation rates if having fewer children causes an increase in labor-force attach- ment (Mary T. Coleman and John Pencavel, 1993). Evidence for this thesis includes Claudia Goldin\u2019s (1995) study, which shows that few women in the 1940\u2019s and 1950\u2019s birth cohorts"

Other researchers have also drawn a link between fertility-induced with- drawals from the labor force and lower wages of women (e.g., Gronau, 1988; Sanders Korenman and David Neumark, 1992). So per- haps childbearing keeps women from develop- ing their careers.\n\nAny success in disentangling the causal mechanisms linking fertility and labor supply should shed light on other substantive issues as well. For example, reductions in female labor supply could increase the total time parents de- vote to child care, making at least some children better off (see, e.g., Frank P. Stafford, 1987; Francine Blau and Adam J. Grossberg, 1992). Some theories of family behavior also suggest that changes in wives\u2019 earnings affect marital stability (Becker et al., 1977; Becker, 1985).\n\nNot surprisingly, given the wide and long- standing interest in the connection between childbearing and labor supply, hundreds of empirical studies report estimates of this re- lationship. The vast majority of these studies find a negative correlation between fetility (or family size) and female labor supply.\u2019 As"

    "text": "Skepticism regarding the causal interpreta- tion of associations between fertility and labor supply arises in part from the fact that there are strong theoretical reasons to believe that fertility and labor supply are jointly deter- mined (see, e.g., Schultz, 1981, or Goldin, 1990). In fact, this endogeneity is reflected in the academic research agenda. On one hand, papers on labor supply often treat child-status variables as regressors in hours of work equa- tions, while on the other hand, economic demographers and others discuss regressions and models that are meant to characterize the impact of wages or measures of labor-force attachment on fertility. Since fertility variables cannot be both dependent and exogenous at the same time, it seems unlikely that either sort of regression has a causal interpretation.\u00ae\n\nThis paper focuses on the causal link run- ning from fertility to the work effort of both\n\nply is discussed by, among others, Orley Ashenfelter and James J.

This instrument ex- ploits the widely observed phenomenon of pa- rental preferences for a mixed sibling-sex composition. In particular, parents of same-sex siblings are significantly and substantially more likely to go on to have an additional child.* Because sex mix is virtually randomly assigned, a dummy for whether the sex of the second child matches the sex of the first child provides a plausible instrument for further childbearing among women with at least two children. Moreover, in spite of the fact that the sibling sex mix is obviously a function of the sex of both children, we present a range of evidence which suggests that there is little pos- sibility that any secular impact of the sex of offspring contaminates the IV estimates.\n\nWe also compare results generated using sex mix as an instrument to results generated using twins to construct instruments.

Rosenbloom (1996), both of which use large Census samples, and Rozenzweig and Wolpin (1980a, b). Here, our interest is primar- ily in the comparison between twins estimates and results using the same-sex instruments. We therefore focus on multiple second births, so that both twinning and the sex-mix instrument iden- tify the impact of moving from the second to the third child. Because third-born children who are twins are older than other third-born children, the juxtaposition of estimates based on twinning and the sex mix allows us to compare the effects of fertility on labor supply when the children are different ages. By combining the twins and same-sex instruments, we can estimate the time it takes for the labor-supply consequences of childbearing to disappear."

All of the husbands\u2019 variables are computed based in this assumption, which seems plausible for the 1980 data since women in the 1980 mar- ried women sample were married only once and they were married at the time of their first birth. Only 4.7 percent of the husbands in this sample were married before, and very few children live with their fathers after divorce. On the other hand, the 1990 match is probably not as good as the 1980 match. We therefore confirmed the basic first-stage relationships used in this paper with June CPS data, which includes true retrospective fertility informa- tion.

Lewis (1973) and Becker and Nigel Tomes (1976), and ex- tended in detail by Rosenzweig and Wolpin (1980a). In these models, parents derive util- ity from the number of children and a comple- mentary good, \u2018\u2018child quality,\u201d\u201d which enters the utility function and budget constraint in proportion to the number of children. Child quality is generated through the purchase of inputs and the expenditure of parents\u2019 time in home production. Ben-Porath and Welch (1980) describe the sex mix as something that determines child quality in quantity/quality of models. Alternately, the impact of sex prefer- ences can be modeled using state-dependent utility. Suppose a mother already has n, = 1 children and she is trying to decide how many additional children to have (n.).

Table 4 reports Same sex contrasts for mother\u2019s age, age at first birth, race, ethnicity, and years of education in the 1980 and 1990 all-women samples. Even in these large samples, none of the con- trasts is significantly different from zero at the 5-percent level. The magnitude of the dif- ferences by Same sex is also very small.

Similarly, when z; is an indicator of multipie births at the second pregnancy, Twins-2, the IV estimates reflect the effect of children on labor supply for those who have had more children than they otherwise would have be- cause of twinning.

Two-Stage Least-Squares Estimation\n\nWhile the Wald estimates provide a simple illustration of how the instruments identify the effect of children on labor supply, the rest of the paper discusses two-stage least-squares (2SLS) and ordinary least-squares (OLS) es- timates of regression models relating labor- market outcomes to fertility and a variety of exogenous covariates. 2SLS estimation allows us to accomplish three things. First, even if there is no association between the instrument and exogenous covariates, as suggested by Ta- ble 4, controlling for exogenous covariates can lead to more precise estimates if the treatment effects are roughly constant across groups.\n\nSecond, we can use 2SLS to control for any secular additive effects of child sex when us- ing Same sex as an instrument.

Morgan et al., 1988) or changes the way parents treat their children (Kristin F. Butcher and Anne Case, 1994; Duncan Thomas, 1994). Secular effects of sex mix on labor supply could also be gen- erated by the fact that boys are more likely than girls to have disabilities (see, e.g., Angrist and Victor Lavy, 1996) since having a dis- abled child might change parents\u2019 behavior. Adding s, and s, as regressors to the estimating equations reduces the likelihood of omitted- variables bias from these sources."

However, a third advantage of the 2SLS framework is that it allows us to exploit the fact that the Same sex instrument can be decomposed into two instruments, leading to an overidentified model. In particular, the sep- arate indicators, Two boys [ ss,] and Two girls [(1 = 5)(1 \u2014 5,)], are both available as po- tential instruments. This is useful because bias from any secular effects of child sex on labor supply should be different for these two in- struments, while the labor-supply conse- quences of childbearing seem likely to be independent of whether Same sex equals Two boys or Two girls. A natural specification test is therefore the conventional instrument-error overidentification test statistic for 2SLS esti- mation using both instruments, since this is the same as a test for whether the Two boys and Two girls instruments give the same estimate when used separately.'"

This is true for the labor- supply estimates in the married women\u2019s sample as well, although here the gap be- tween 2SLS and OLS estimates is not as large. Overall, however, the OLS estimates appear to exaggerate the causal effect of fer- tility on female labor supply.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the relationship between the OLS and 2SLS estimates is sim- ilar when the estimates are converted into per- child units. Above, we noted that 2SLS esti- mates treating More than 2 children as the en- dogenous regressor should be multiplied by about 0.75 to obtain estimates in per-child terms (i.e., with Number of children as the en- dogenous regressor). It turns out that the OLS estimates can be converted into per-child units by multiplying by about 0.7 using either 1980 or 1990 data. Thus, regardless of whether the estimates are cast in terms of the effect of hav- ing more than two children or in per-child units, the OLS estimates are considerably smaller than the 2SLS estimates."

The small and statistically insignificant 2SLS estimates in the In(Non-wife income) equations suggest that this is not the case. The most likely ex- planation is that the instrument is not powerful enough to detect the family-income conse- quences of childbearing. For example, in the married women sample, the third child reduces female earnings by about 21 percent and fe- male labor income is (on average) 13 percent of total family income. If the third child does not alter husbands\u2019 labor supply, we would ex- pect an estimated effect of More than 2 chil- dren in the In(Family income) equations of roughly \u20140.21 X 0.13 = \u20140.027, which is close to the reported estimate of \u20140.05.

Some of the es- timated effects are slightly smaller in 1990 than in 1980, but these differences are not sta- tistically meaningful. One difference between the 1980 and 1990 results that does seem note- worthy is the larger negative impact of child- bearing on married women\u2019s earnings in 1990, perhaps because of an increase in women\u2019s\n\nwages. This result may also be attributable to the fact that married women are delaying childbearing (average age at first birth in- creased from 20.8 in 1980 to 22.4 in 1990 for this group), and therefore they have more years of experience and higher wages when they exit the workforce due to childbirth."

    "text": "A number of theoretical models describe how the impact of children on labor supply might vary with the wages or schooling of hus- bands or wives. For example, Angrist and Evans (1996b) outline a version of Gronau\u2019s (1977) model of market work and home pro- duction that incorporates child quality effects of the sort discussed by Becker and Lewis (1973). This model predicts that higher own wages of either partner magnify the labor- supply consequences of childbearing, al- though there are no cross-wage effects.' Gronau\u2019s survey paper (1986 p. 287) refers to a number of empirical studies consistent with this prediction, showing that the labor supply of more educated women is more sensitive to the presence of children than the labor supply of less educated women. Earlier, Gronau (1973 p. S170) reported finding that the effect of a child on his mother\u2019s value of time in- creases with the mother\u2019s education. On the other hand, an assumption implicit in most em- pirical labor-supply models, where the focus is on wage effects and not the consequences of childbearing, is that there are no interactions in the effect of wages and the number of chil- dren (see, e.g., Thomas A. Mroz, 1987)."

Although the effects of children are generally ambiguous, in the Angrist and Evans (1996b) model, increasing the number of chil- dren increases time spent at home because of returns to scale in parental time spent on child-rearing. Returns to scale are larger when the marginal return to hours (and hence wages) are higher."

Panel A of Table 9 reports OLS and 2SLS estimates of the effect of More than 2 children on married women, conditional on the position of their husbands in the husbands\u2019 earnings distribution. The first column shows the first-stage relationship between More than 2 children and Same sex, interacted with dum- mies that indicate whether husbands\u2019 earnings are in the upper third, middle third, or lower third of the earnings distribution. These esti- mates show that the effect of Same sex on fer- tility is increasing in husbands\u2019 earnings. For women with high-wage husbands, however, 2SLS estimates of labor-supply effects are smaller and they are not significantly different from zero. Note that average participation rates do not decline enough with husbands\u2019 earnings to account for the decline in the mag- nitude of the coefficients among women with high-wage husbands. It is also worth noting that the OLS estimates do not decline nearly as much with husbands\u2019 earnings as do the 2SLS estimates."

But we can condition on schooling, which is an important predictor of individual earnings potential. This is done in Panel B of Table 9 for married women in the 1980 sample with less than a high-school education (18 percent of the sample), high-school graduates (49 percent of the sample), and more than a high-school edu- cation (33 percent of the sample). The reduced forms show a strong association between Same sex and fertility in each schooling group, al- though the effect is about 1 percentage point smaller for mothers in the highest education cat- egory. The 2SLS estimates suggest that women with relatively low levels of schooling experi- ence the largest effects of children on labor sup- ply. In contrast, there is no statistically significant association between additional child- bearing and labor supply for women with more than a high-school education. As with the esti- mates that condition on husbands\u2019 earnings, the variation in 2SLS estimates by schooling group differs from the variation in OLS estimates,"

We therefore present estimates by mothers\u2019 education group in a sample restricted to women whose husbands have earnings in the middle third of the earnings distribution. Again, the 2SLS estimates suggest that the impact of childbearing on labor supply declines as ed- ucation rises, contradicting a theoretical prediction and the OLS estimates, both of which suggest that the labor supply of more educated women responds more to the pres- ence of children. This finding is even more remarkable when viewed in light of the fact that participation rates increase with moth- ers schooling. It should be noted, however, that while the results by education group differ substantially, and the pattern of differences is consistent across outcomes, the estimates for subgroups are not very precise."

Bronars and Grogger (1994) were the first to study the consequences of multiple births with Census data. They used twins in the 1970 and 1980 PUMS to estimate the effect of additional childbearing on mothers\u2019 labor- market status, though most of their estimates are for unwed mothers. Gangadharan and Rosenbloom (1996) also used Census twins to estimate the reduced-form effect of twinning on labor-supply variables, but they fail to scale the reduced-form effects of twinning into effects of childbearing. These studies focused almost ex- clusively on twinning at first birth.

Although the contrast between Same sex and Twins-2 coefficient estimates is not large enough to be statistically significant for many of the individual coefficients, the comparison of estimates strongly suggests these two shocks have different effects.\n\nA likely explanation for the smaller Twins-2 effects is that, conditional on the age of the second child, a third child who is born as a consequence of twinning is nec- essarily older than a third child who is born for other reasons.

Because second-born twins are younger, on average, than firstborn twins, age differences could also explain why the effects of twins at second birth briefly mentioned by Bronars and Grogger in the text of their article (p. 1149) are larger than their estimates of the effects of twins at first birth.'\u00ae\n\nIV.

A number of researchers have attempted to decompose the rise in the female labor-force participation rates into components attributable to demand and sup- ply shifts. For example, Mincer (1962) con- cluded that 90 percent of the rise in postwar labor-force participation of married women can be attributed to an increase in demand. James P. Smith and Ward (1984) also found that demand characteristics can explain a ma- jority of the increase in total hours worked by all women in between 1850 and 1980. In con- trast, Goldin (1990) argues that shifts in sup- ply explain about half of the change in female\n\n' The fact that the Bronars and Grogger estimates are less precise than the twins estimates reported here is likely due to their having drawn a 1-percent sample of singleton births for the comparison sample. Note also that Bronars and Grogger's estimates are for the reduced-form impact of twinning; for purposes of comparison, these estimates should be scaled up by dividing by the twins first-stage effect (about 0.68 in their data)."

How much of the trend in labor- force attachment in the population we have studied can be accounted for by reduced child- bearing beyond the second child? Table 1 showed that the probability of having more than two children for women aged 215 with at least two children fell by 16.5 percentage points between 1970 and 1990, a drop of about 30 percent. At the same time, labor-force par- ticipation rates rose by 21.8 percentage points, a 49-percent increase. Similar statistics for other groups reported in Table 1 show that our sample is not unusual in experiencing these trends."

The evidence reported here is unique in that it derives from plausibly exogenous sources of variation in family size.

This is probably not too surprising, at least not to the mothers of small children. What is surprising is that the effects of children on labor supply appear to\n\nbe much smaller and possibly even absent among college-educated women and women whose husbands have high wages. This result contradicts the predictions of some theories of household time allocation as well as the OLS results, which suggest that the labo- supply consequences of childbearing are larger for more educated women. Our esti- mates consistently show that the labor-market consequences of childbearing are more likely to be severe for poor and less educated women."

Even the husbands of well-educated and relatively well-paid women do not change their work habits in response to the birth of a child. Thus, families absorb the cost of caring for a third child either through a reduction in wife\u2019s earnings or by purchasing child-care services from nonfamily providers. If addi- tional childbearing does lead husbands to put additional time into home production of child care, this is done at the expense of the hus- band\u2019s leisure time and not through a reduc- tion in his work effort. We also find little evidence of an increase in husbands\u2019 earnings that would offset the decline in wives\u2019 earn- ings. In spite of the increase in women\u2019s wages and labor-force participation rates dur- ing the period studied here, the labor-market behavior of most married men appears to have remained largely insensitive to the num- ber of children.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nAngrist, Joshua D. \u2018Grouped-Data Estimation and Testing in Simple Labor Supply Mod- els.\u201d\u201d Journal of Econometrics, February\u2014 March 1991, 47(2-3), pp. 243\u201466."
