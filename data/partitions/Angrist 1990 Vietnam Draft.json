    "text": "Lifetime Earnings and the Vietnam Era Draft Lottery: Evidence from Social Security Administrative Records\n\nBy JOSHUA D. ANGRIST*\n\nThe randomly assigned risk of induction generated by the draft lottery is used to construct estimates of the effect of veteran status on civilian earnings. These estimates are not biased by the fact that certain types of men are more likely than others to service in the military. Social Security administrative records indicate that in the early 1980s, long after their service in Vietnam was ended, the earnings of white veterans were approximately 15 percent less than the earnings of comparable nonveterans.

    "text": "A central question in the debate over mili- tary manpower policy is whether veterans are adequately compensated for their service. The political process clearly reflects the de- sire to compensate veterans: since World War II, millions of veterans have enjoyed benefits for medical care, education and training, housing, insurance, and job place- ment. Recent legislation provides additional benefits for veterans of the Vietnam era. Yet, academic research has not shown conclu- sively that Vietnam (or other) veterans are worse off economically than nonveterans. Many studies find that Vietnam veterans earn less than nonveterans, but others find posi- tive effects, or effects that vary with age and",

For exam- ple, men with relatively few civilian opportu- nities are probably more likely to enlist.

If draft eligibility is correlated with veteran status but uncorrelated with other variables related to earnings, then earnings differences by draft-eligibility status can be attributed to military service. In Sec- tion III, information on the proportions of draft-eligible and draft-ineligible men who actually served in the military is used to convert estimates of the effect of draft eligi- bility into estimates of the effect of military service. The assumptions underlying this procedure are those that justify instrumental variables estimation; in principle, any func- tion of the RSN provides a legitimate instru- ment for veteran status. In the second part of Section III, an instrumental variables esti- mation strategy is developed which is more efficient than one based solely on draft-eligi- bility status. Results in Section III indicate that white veterans earn approximately 15 percent less than nonveterans as much as ten years after their discharge from the military.",

Background and Data\n\nA. National Random Selection3\n\nThere were five draft lotteries during the Vietnam War period. The 1970 lottery cov- ered 19- to 26-year-old men born in 1944-50, although most of the men drafted in 1970 were born in 1950. Other lotteries were re- stricted to 19- and 20-year-olds. The 1971 lottery covered men born in 1951, the 1972 lottery covered men born in 1952, and so on, through 1975. However, no one was drafted after 1972, and congressional conscription authority expired in July 1973.",

    "text": "Draft lottery RSNs were randomly as- signed in a televised drawing held a few months before men reaching draft age were to be called.4 Draft-eligibility ceilings-RSN 195 in 1970, RSN 125 in 1971, and RSN 95 in 1972-were announced later in the year, once Defense Department manpower needs were known. As a consequence of this delay, many men with low numbers volunteered for the military to avoid being drafted and to improve their terms of service (Angrist 1989b). There was even a behavioral re- sponse to the lottery in enlistment rates for the 1953 cohort, although no one born in 1953 was drafted. In the analysis that fol- lows, the \"draft-eligibility ceiling\" for men born in 1953 is set at RSN 95, the highest lottery number called in 1972.\n\n3This section draws on Curtis Tarr (1981) and the Selective Service System (1986).\n\n4Men born from 1944-49 were already of draft age when the 1970 lottery was held on December 1, 1969. For nonveterans in this group, subsequent liability for service was determined by 1970 lottery numbers.\n\nThis content downloaded from 18.9.61.112 on Tue, 07 Nov 2017 21:08:27 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\n\nVOL. 80 NO. 3",

Subsequent selection from the draft-eligible, nondeferred pool was based on a number of criteria. The most important screening criteria were the pre- induction physical examination and a mental aptitude test. In 1970, for example, half of all registrants failed pre-induction examina- tions and 20 percent of those who passed were eliminated by physical inspections con- ducted at induction (Selective Service Sys- tem, 1971). Of course, the fact that armed forces selection criteria were ultimately not random does not mean that the initial prior- ity for induction was not randomly assigned by RSN.",

In principle, nonveterans born between 1944 and 1949 continued to be at risk of induction in the 1970 lottery, but the majority of men who ended up serving from these cohorts had already entered the military by the time of the 1970 lottery drawing. Veterans born from 1944-49 who managed to avoid service until 1970 may not constitute a representative sample.

The fact that earnings do not differ by draft-eligibility status before the lotteries is a consequence of the random assignment of draft eligibility. The only thing that distinguishes draft-eligible men from draft-ineligible men is the higher conscrip- tion risk faced by eligible men after the lottery.",

This figure plots the time-series of differences in earnings by draft-eligibility status for each cohort. As in Figure 1, Figure 2 shows no difference during the years before the year of conscription risk, while in subsequent years, the earnings histories diverge. Figure 2 also shows that the loss of earnings to draft-eligi- ble white men was largest during the period they were most likely to be in the service.\n\nHowever, the earnings of draft-eligible white men continued to lag behind the earnings of draft-ineligible white men through 1984.\n\nThe picture for nonwhites is less clear. The earnings of draft-eligible nonwhites born in 1950 and 1951 exceed those of draft- ineligible nonwhites in some of the later years. On the other hand, for nonwhites born in 1952, time-series variation in earnings differences by eligibility status is similar to that of whites. The general impression for the three older cohorts of nonwhites is that the earnings of draft-eligible men at least had caught up with the earnings of draft-in- eligible men by 1984.",

Men who volunteer for the military are probably less likely than draftees to suf- fer a career disadvantage from their service.\n\nEstimates of the effect of draft eligibility are reported in Table 1 for both FICA earn- ings and W-2 earnings. Standard errors asso- ciated with the estimates are reported in parentheses. The statistics in Table 1 show that the loss in FICA earnings to draft-eli- gible white men is sometimes statistically significant and amounts to 2-3 percent of earnings. Estimated W-2 earnings losses are similar, but tend to be larger and more vari- able than the estimated losses in FICA earn- ings. In contrast, differences in earnings by draft-eligibility status for nonwhites rarely exceed their standard errors.\n\nElsewhere (Angrist 1989c), I have shown that draft-eligible white men are less likely to have earnings above the FICA taxable maximum than draft-ineligible white men.",

    "text": "The effect of draft eligibility on nonwhites' probability of being at the taxable maxi- mum, although imprecisely measured, also appears to go in the same direction as the effect of draft eligibility on mean earnings. These results are worth noting because, when the effect of draft eligibility on the probabil- ity of being censored has the same sign as the effect on earnings, estimates tabulated using censored data tend to underestimate the true effect.6\n\nSThe effect of censoring on estimated treatment ef- fects is discussed in the appendix. Angrist (1989c) also reports estimates of the effect of draft eligibility on the probability of having no recorded earnings. These tabu- lations indicate that draft-eligible whites were somewhat more likely to have had FICA earnings during the years in which they were in the service, and that draft-eligible nonwhites are more likely to have had no earnings in recent years. There is no statistically significant evi- dence for either race, however, of any lasting effect of draft eligibility on the probability of having zero earn- ings.",

    "text": "where A is the proportion of the cohort actually entering the military, - is mean earnings, and superscript e and superscript n denote the draft-eligible and draft-ineligi- ble samples. Note that the numerator of (2) consists of estimates of the effect of draft eligibility plotted in Figure 2.\n\nIntuitively, equation (2) simply adjusts earnings differences by draft-eligibility status for the fact that not all draft-eligible men actually served in the military, while some men who were not draft eligible voluntarily enlisted for service. The justification for esti- mation of the effects of military service in this manner is clear: it is assumed that noth- ing other than differences in the probability of being a veteran is responsible for differ- ences in earnings by draft-eligibility status. This formula may also be recognized as an application of Abraham Wald's (1940) grouping method, where the data have been grouped by draft-eligibility status. Applica- tions of this formula will therefore be re- ferred to here as \"Wald estimates.\"",

These estimates are tabulated from a special ver- sion of the 1984 Survey of Income and Pro- gram Participation (SIPP). The SIPP data used here were matched to an indicator of draft-eligibility status from information on birthdates included in the Census Bureau's in-house version of the SIPP file. Additional details on the SIPP data are provided in Section 7 of the Appendix.\n\nIn the upper panel of Table 2, the columns labeled pe and An show probabilities of veteran status tabulated using the SIPP. Be- cause of the small number of observations available for single-cohort statistics, each SIPP estimate is actually the average for three consecutive cohorts. For example, SIPP estimates assigned to men born in 1951 are based on data for men born in 1950, 1951, and 1952. The last column of Table 2, la- beled pe _ Apn, shows the difference in the probability of military service by draft-eligi- bility status. Estimates of the effect of draft",

    "text": "eligibility on veteran status for whites born 1950-52 range from 0.10 to 0.16. Thus, a rule of thumb for conversion of draft-eligi- bility treatment effects into estimates of the effects of military service is to multiply by 1/0.15 = 6 2/3.\n\nWald estimates of the effect of military service for selected cohorts and years are presented in Table 3. The sample is re- stricted to the subset of whites born 1950-52 because the results in Table 2 suggest that this is the group for whom draft eligibility is most likely to be a useful instrument. Earn- ings variables are for 1981-84 because the impact of military service in these years rep- resents a long-term effect. Furthermore, as a practical matter, both FICA and W-2 earn- ings data are likely to be more reliable in recent years-the FICA data because of in- creased employment coverage and the W-2 data because of improvements in data collec- tion procedures.",

Column (1) pre- sents estimates for FICA earnings and col- umn (3) presents estimates for W-2 earnings; the figures in both of these columns are copied directly from Table 1. In addition, column (2) reports estimates for an earnings series constructed by applying a simple non-parametric correction for censoring to the FICA earnings data. The correction pro- cedure is described in detail in Section 6 of the Appendix. Briefly, data are adjusted for censoring by using the fraction with recorded earnings at the taxable maximum, combined with mean earnings above the taxable maxi- mum estimated from Current Population Surveys, to estimate population mean earn- ings from censored mean earnings. Note that the effects estimated using the adjusted data are usually bracketed by the effects esti- mated using the unadjusted FICA and W-2 data. Therefore, only Wald estimates con- structed from the adjusted data are reported in the table.",

A more efficient estimator exploits all the information on RSNs in the aggregate data by fitting earnings model (1) to obser- vations on mean earnings for each group of\n\nVn (3\u00a2 = 3\")/( \u2014 p\"). The standard error is therefore equal to 1/(p\u2014 p\") times the standard error of the numerator because the numerator has a nondegenerate limiting distribution, while (\u20ac \u2014 p\") converges to a constant. The same standard error formulas arise from application of conventional Instrumental Variables for- mulas.",

These figures show that, with the exception of the 1950 cohort, the SIPP and DMDC/CWHS procedures give reasonably similar estimates of _ - p\". Inaccuracy of the DMDC/ CWHS estimates for 1950 is a consequence of the fact that DMDC administrative records are unavailable before July 1970. Therefore, despite the limitations of the SIPP data, the SIPP must be used to construct probabilities for the 1950 cohort. The SIPP sample is too small to allow estimation of a complete set of p for all lottery number cells in 1950. Consequently, SIPP estimates for 1950 are computed for only two cells, defined by draft-eligibility status, and CWHS earnings data for men born in 1950 are also grouped by draft eligibility. Thus, for each race and year, the sample used to estimate equation (3) includes 73 cell means for each of the three cohorts born from 1951-53, plus two cell means for the 1950 cohort.",

    "text": "The results in Table 4 show that white veterans born from 1950-52 suffered an an- nual earnings loss of between $1,500 and $2,100 constant (1978) dollars. These results generally are similar in magnitude to the Wald estimates reported in Table 3. Also, as in Table 3, regression estimates for adjusted FICA earnings tend to be bracketed by the results for unadjusted FICA and W-2 earn- ings. Although many of the estimates for individual cohorts in Model 1 are not signif- icant, the combined estimates for whites in Model 2 are substantially larger than twice their standard errors. In contrast, results for nonwhites show no evidence of a statistically significant earnings loss to veterans.\n\nThe overidentification test statistics re- ported in Table 4 take on values less than their degrees of freedom, suggesting that the residuals in equation (1) are not correlated with lottery-based instruments.12 It should be noted, however, that low values of the test statistics may indicate low power in a test with so many degrees of freedom. On the other hand, without a particular alternative hypothesis in mind, it seems natural to re- port the omnibus goodness-of-fit test.",

Model 1 allows the effect of veteran status on earnings to vary by cohort, while Model 2 restricts estimated service ef- fects to be the same across cohorts.

Estimates of a for use in the formula for (D were computed by weighted least squares using the inverse of the sampling variance of the - as weights. Estimates of V(y) and V(p) are discussed in Section 5 of the Appendix. Note that the TSIV estimator may also be motivated as an application of Optimal Minimum Distance (OMD) techniques such as those described by Gary Chamberlain (1982). Ignor- ing period and cohort effects, OMD estimates for the current problem are tabulated by choosing a and p to minimize\n\nq(a,P) = [y - PC' V(y) 0 1 y_pal LP-P p Lo V(p')] L-P p\n\nBy concentrating out the estimate of p, it is easy to show that q(a, p) = m(0).\n\nThis content downloaded from 18.9.61.112 on Tue, 07 Nov 2017 21:08:27 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\n\n326",

First, earnings model (1) must be an accurate representation of the impact of military service. Second, functions of the draft lottery must be valid instru- ments for s, in the earnings regressions. Three models leading to the failure of these assumptions are discussed briefly below. The first two, incorporating treatment effect het- erogeneity and missing covariates, merely re- sult in a reinterpretation of the estimates. The third model, allowing for earnings-mod- ifying draft-avoidance behavior, calls into question the assumption that earnings dif- ferences by lottery number can be attributed solely to veteran status.\n\nA. Treatment Effect Heterogeneity\n\nThe effect of veteran status can only be estimated for those who served in the armed forces. If veterans are more or less likely to benefit from military service than the rest of the population, then the estimated veteran status coefficient does not characterize the impact of veteran status on a random sam- ple. This problem is formalized in the ran- dom coefficients model for treatment effect heterogeneity:",

For example, veterans might have a higher level of educational attainment because of financial aid available through the GI Bill.

Such correlation will bias estimates of the effects of military service constructed using the lottery. But in a previous study using micro data (Angrist, 1989a), specification tests provided no evidence of a relationship between lottery numbers and characteristics other than veteran status. The overidentifi- cation test statistics reported here also show no evidence of omitted variables bias. Fi- nally, even if having a low lottery number is correlated with a tendency to stay in school, the fact that earnings rise with schooling implies that lottery-based estimates of the effect of veteran status will tend to underes- timate the true effect.\n\nVI.

On the other hand, Mark Berger and Barry Hirsch (1983) find essentially no effect on 1977 weekly earnings, and Angrist (1989a) reports OLS coefficients of zero when using the National Longitudinal Survey (NLS) to estimate the effects of veteran status on hourly wages. In contrast to the OLS esti- mates, lottery-based estimates from the NLS indicate that white veterans had lower hourly wages in 1981 than their nonveteran coun- terparts. Similar results from the SIPP are reported in Angrist (1989c). Thus, lottery- based estimates from a variety of sources provide conclusive evidence that white Viet- nam veterans were disadvantaged by their service.18",

Goodness-of-fit tests sug- gest that for whites, the time-series of vet- eran status coefficients is consistent with this hypothesis. Experience-earnings profiles esti- mated using Social Security data imply that white veterans suffered an earnings reduc- tion equivalent to the loss of two years civil- ian labor market experience.",

    "text": "The analysis reported here leads naturally to further research on a number of topics. One of these is the question of alternatives to the loss-of-experience explanation for the reduction in white veterans' earnings. Vet- eran status may be a screening device, as suggested by DeTray (1982), or there may be cohort size effects such as those discussed by Finis Welch (1979). Because the Social Secu- rity data include information on variances, testable implications of these theories might also include restrictions on second, as well as first, moments. Another question for future research is whether draft eligibility affected educational and career plans independently of its effect on military service. The lottery\n\nmay provide a useful tool for research on changing educational attainment in the 1960s and 1970s.",

    "text": "Finally, there remains the question of rec- onciling the loss of earnings to Vietnam era veterans with the apparent benefits of mili- tary service to veterans of World War II and other eras (Rosen and Taubman, 1982; Berger and Hirsch, 1983). Elsewhere, Alan Krueger and I have argued that the need for reconciliation is, at least in part, illusory (Angrist and Krueger, 1989). Although OLS regressions usually show that the effect of World War II veteran status is large, posi- tive, and significant, these results may actu- ally be a consequence of selection bias. By exploiting the fact that World War II vet- eran status is also correlated with exact date of birth, we have implemented an instrumen- tal variables estimation strategy similar in spirit to the one used here. The results of this procedure indicate that the true impact of World War II veteran status on earnings is no larger than zero and may well be negative.\n\nAPPENDIX: DATA SOURCES AND METHODS\n\n1.

Self-employed workers report their earnings annually on schedule SE of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form 1040, which is forwarded to the SSA by the IRS.

For the sample period used here, the most important coverage exceptions are the majority of federal civilian employees, some state and local government employees, some agricultural and do- mestic workers, and the employees of some nonprofit organizations. A view of coverage by industry in 1981 is given in Robert Meyer (1985, Table 2.1). Meyer's fig- ures for state, local, and civilian federal government employees imply that by 1981, roughly 58 percent of all civilian government workers were covered.\n\nFICA taxable maximums are reported in Appendix Table Al. The combined effects of limited coverage and censoring at the taxable maximum are conveniently summarized by the percentage of all earnings that are reported to the SSA. These statistics, reported in De- partment of Health and Human Services (1987, Table 30), show that after 1981 over 90 percent of wage and salary earnings and over 75 percent of self-employment earnings were reported to the SSA.",

Draft lottery num- bers were then matched to the dates of birth using lottery number tables in Selective Service System Semi- annual Reports for 1969-73. A small number of indi- viduals were discarded from the final data set because there was no information on either their sex, race, or exact date of birth.\n\n4. CWHS Descriptive Statistics",

    "text": "Descriptive statistics for the CWHS cohorts studied here are reported in Table Al. The combined statistics for four cohorts were constructed by computing weighted averages of cohort means. Unless otherwise noted, statistics in the table refer to men with positive earnings. Sample sizes decline over time due to attrition from mortality.\n\nThe descriptive statistics indicate that after 1972 the fraction of men in the sample with zero FICA earnings varies roughly between 15 and 22 percent for whites and\n\nbetween 33 and 36 percent for blacks. To evaluate these figures, note that the author's tabulations show that roughly 10 percent of white men in these cohorts have zero recorded wage and salary earnings in the late 1970s' Current Population Surveys. Suppose that of the 90 percent who work, 12 percent are in the uncovered sector so that only 79 percent of the cohort may be expected to have positive FICA wage and salary earn- ings. Adding an estimated 5 percent who only have FICA self-employment earnings implies that 16 percent should have zero FICA earnings of any type. Thus, 14-18 percent of CWHS earnings being zero for whites between 1973 and 1980 does not seem unreasonable.",

    "text": "In recent years, the fraction with zero earnings ap- pears to be too high to be accounted for by labor force participation or employment in the uncovered sector. This is probably because of the long delay in filing and recording Social Security taxable earnings. In their anal- ysis of Social Security data, Card and Sullivan (1988) also note the problems caused by filing delay. Problems of undercoverage and filing delay may be especially severe for nonwhites. The 15 percent of CPS nonwhites with zero wage and salary earnings is not large enough to explain the approximately 34 percent of nonwhites with zero FICA earnings in the CWHS.",

    "text": "The fraction with FICA earnings at the taxable max- imum is more variable than the fraction with zero earnings, ranging from 3 to 15 percent for whites and between 2 to 10 percent for blacks. The FICA earnings of men with multiple employers can exceed the taxable maximum because reported earnings are censored by source. The fraction of men with FICA earnings above the taxable maximum is around 1-2 percent. The W-2 and FICA earnings series show roughly equal fractions at or above the FICA taxable maximum, suggesting that both variables are drawn from the same underlying distribution. But problems with early years of the W-2 series are clearly reflected in the sample statistics. For example, the standard deviation of whites' W-2 earnings in 1978 is six times the mean and does not fall below the mean until 1981. Another disturbing feature of the W-2 series is that nominal earnings appear to fall from 1978-80. The W-2 series also has a substantially higher fraction of zeros than the FICA series does. However, part of this difference is caused by the inclusion of self-employment earnings in the FICA series. Also, gen- erally there are some individuals with FICA taxable earnings but no",

Correlations are converted to covariances using the within cell variances available from the CWHS data. This procedure is also applied to the adjusted FICA series described in Section 6 of the Appendix, with the modification that adjusted standard errors (diagonal elements of Q) are used to convert correlations to covariances.\n\nThe covariance matrix of p is also block diagonal, with elements equal to the variance of PCj in every element of the block corresponding to the time series for cohort c and lottery cell j. The variance of Pcj is estimated using the standard formula for an estimated proportion. The sample size in the formula is taken to be the size of the SIPP cohort for those born in 1950 and the size of the CWHS cohort for those born from 1951 to 53.\n\n6.
