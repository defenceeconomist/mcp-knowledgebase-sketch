KRUEGER\n\n\u2018We establish that season of birth is related to educational attainment because of school start age policy and compulsory school attendance laws. Individuals born in the beginning of the year start school at an older age, and can therefore drop out after completing less schooling than individuals born near the end of the year. Roughly 25 percent of potential dropouts remain in school because of compulsory schooling laws. We estimate the impact of compulsory schooling on earnings by using quarter of birth as an instrument for education. The instrumental variables estimate of the return to education is close to the ordinary least squares estimate, suggesting that there is little bias in conventional estimates.",

    "text": "In the next section we present an analysis of data from three decennial Censuses that establishes that season of birth is indeed related to educational attainment. Remarkably, in virtually all of the birth cohorts that we have examined, children born in the first quarter of the year have a slightly lower average level of education than children born later in the year. School districts typically require a student to have turned age six by January 1 of the year in which he or she enters school (see HEW [1959]). Therefore, students born earlier in the year enter school at an older age and attain the legal dropout age at an earlier point in their educational careers than students born later in the year. If the fraction of students who want to drop out prior to the legal dropout age is independent of season of birth, then the observed seasonal pattern in education is consistent with the view that compulsory schooling constrains some students born later in the year to stay in school longer.",

First, the seasonal pattern in education is not evident in college graduation rates, nor is it evident in graduate school completion rates. Because compulsory schooling laws do not compel individuals to attend school beyond high school, this evidence supports our hypothesis that the relationship be- tween years of schooling and date of birth is entirely due to compulsory schooling laws. Second, in comparing enrollment rates of fifteen- and sixteen-year olds in states that have an age sixteen schooling requirement with enrollment rates in states that have an age seventeen schooling requirement, we find a greater decline in the enrollment of sixteen-year olds in states that permit sixteen- year olds to leave school than in states that compel sixteen-year olds to attend school.",

Because these individuals were not constrained by compulsory schooling requirements, they form a natural control group to test whether season of birth affects earnings for reasons other than compulsory schooling. The results of this exploration suggest that there is no relationship between earnings and season of birth for men who are not constrained by compulsory schooling. This strengthens our interpretation that the TSLS estimate of the return to education reflects the effect of compulsory school attendance.",

    "text": "Our findings have important implications for the literature on omitted variables bias in estimates of the return to education (see Griliches [1977] and Willis [1986] for surveys). Economists have devoted a great deal of attention to correcting for bias in the return to education due to omitted ability and other factors that are positively correlated with both education and earnings. This type of a bias would occur, for example, in Spence\u2019s [1973] signaling model, where workers with high innate ability are assumed to find school less difficult and to obtain more schooling to signal their high ability. In contrast to this prediction, estimates based on season of birth indicate that, if anything, conventional OLS estimates are biased slightly downward.\n\n1.

    "text": "Students who are born early in the calendar year are typically older when they enter school than children born late in the year. For example, our tabulation of the 1960 Census (the earliest census that contains quarter of birth), shows that, on average, boys born in the first quarter of the year enter first grade when they are 6.45 years old, whereas boys born in the fourth quarter of the year enter first grade when they are 6.07 years old.\u201d This pattern arises because most school districts do not admit students to first grade unless they will attain age six by January 1 of the academic year in which they enter school. Consequently, students who were born in the beginning of the year are older when they start school than students who were born near the end of the year. Because children born in the first quarter of the year enter school at an older age, they attain the legal dropout age after having attended school for a shorter period of time than those born near the end of the year. Hence, if a fixed fraction of students is constrained by the compulsory attendance law, those born in the beginning of the year will have less schooling, on average, than those born near the end of the",

    "text": "To further examine the seasonal pattern in education, it is useful to remove the trend in years of education across cohorts. A flexible way to detrend the series is by subtracting off a moving average of the surrounding birth cohort\u2019s average education. For each quarter we define a two-period, two-sided moving average, MA(+2,-2), as the average education of men born in the two preceding and two succeeding quarters.\u00ae Specifically, for the cohort e 18 men born in year \u00a2 and quarter j, the MA(+2,\u20142), denoted MA,\n\nMA,=E ,+E +E +E)/4\n\nwhere E is the average years of education attained by the cohort born \u00a2 quarters before or after cohort c,j. The \u201cdetrended\u201d education series is simply E,, \u2014 MA, ;.\n\nThe relationship between season of birth and years of educa- tion for the detrended education series is depicted in Figure IV for each ten-year-age group. The figures clearly show that season of birth is related to years of completed education. For example, in 27 of the 29 birth years, the average education of men born in the first quarter of the year (January\u2014March) is less than that predicted by the surrounding quarters based on the MA(+2,\u20142).",

For both cohorts the average num- ber of completed years of schooling is about one tenth of a year lower for men born in the first quarter of the year than for men born in the last quarter of the year. Similarly, the table shows that, for the 1930s cohort, men born in the first quarter of the year are 1.9 percentage points less likely to graduate from high school than men born in the last quarter of the year.\u201d For the 1940s cohort the gap in the high school graduation rate between first and fourth quarter births is 1.5 percentage points. Because the high school dropout rate is 23 percent for men born in the 1930s and 14 percent for men born in the 1940s, first quarter births are roughly 10 percent more likely to drop out of high school than fourth quarter births.",

Because individuals with higher degrees did not discontinue their education as soon as they were legally permitted, these findings provide further support for the view that compulsory schooling is responsible for the seasonal pattern in education. Moreover, because season of birth is correlated with age at school entry, the lack of a seasonal pattern in postsecondary education suggests that differences in school entry age alone do not have a significant effect on educational attainment. In the absence of compulsory schooling, therefore, we would not expect to find differences in education by season of birth.\n\nA. Direct Evidence on the Effect of Compulsory Schooling Laws",

In states where sixteen-year olds are permitted to drop out of school, the percent of students enrolled is 4.5 points lower for students who have turned age sixteen than for those who are almost age sixteen (see row 3).

The contrast between the within-state and within-age-group comparisons is a difference-in-differences estima- tor of the effect of compulsory school attendance that controls for both additive age and state effects. For the 1944 cohort the difference-in-differences estimate indicates that compulsory school attendance laws increased the enrollment rate by four percentage points in states with an age seventeen or age eighteen minimum schooling requirement.\n\nRows 4-6 of Table II report the corresponding statistics for individuals born in 1954 using data from the 1970 Census, and",

The difference-in- differences estimates of the enrollment effect of compulsory school- ing for the 1954 and 1964 cohorts are 2 and 0.5 percentage points. A significant number of students leave school around the time of their birthday, although the effect of compulsory attendance laws is smaller in 1970 than in 1960, and smalier still in 1980 than in 1970.",

    "text": "Although the fraction of students kept in school by compulsory education laws may seem small relative to the total population of students, the estimate represents a nontrivial fraction of the pool of students who eventually drop out of high school. In 1960 about 12 percent of sixteen-year-old students had dropped out of school in states where they were permitted to do so. Therefore, our estimates imply that in 1960 compulsory attendance laws kept approximately one third of potential dropouts in school. By 1980 only 5 percent of sixteen-year olds had dropped out of school, so our estimates imply that compulsory schooling laws kept roughly 10 percent of potential dropouts in school in that year.\n\nThe waning effect of compulsory schooling may result from an increase in desired levels of education for more recent cohorts, which makes compulsory schooling less of a constraint, or from increasingly lax enforcement of compulsory schooling laws. In either case the declining effect of compulsory schooling laws is consistent with the smaller seasonal pattern in education for recent cohorts.\n\nB. Why Do Compulsory Schooling Laws Work?",

First, the Fair Labor Standards Act prohibits the employment of children under age fourteen, and every state in the United States has a child labor\n\n11.

Moreover, in all states young workers must obtain a work certifi- cate (or work permit) to be eligible for employment.

First, men born in the first quarter of the year\u2014who, on average, have lower education\u2014also tend to earn slightly less per week than men born in surrounding months.

Therefore, we mainly focus on 40-49 year-old men, whose wages are hardly related to age. Analyzing this sample enables us to avoid the effects of life-cycle changes in earnings that are correlated with quarter of birth.",

In 1970, for example, men born in the first quarter of the year earned a 0.7 percent lower weekly wage and had completed 0.126 fewer years of education than men born in the last three quarters of the year. The ratio of these two numbers, 0.072, is a consistent estimate of the return to education provided that season of birth is uncorrelated with earnings determinants other than education. Intuitively, the Wald estimator is likely to provide a consistent\n\n12. Longitudinal estimates of the age-earnings profile, which follow the same cohorts over time, also typically show a relatively flat relationship between age and earnings for 40-49 year-old men.\n\n13. The Wald estimate is a special case of instrumental variables [Durbin, 1954]. In this case the Wald estimate is equivalent to instrumental variables where adummy variable indicating whether an individual is born in the first quarter of the year is used as an instrument for education, and there are no covariates.",

Regardless of the set of included regressors, the TSLS and OLS estimates of the return to education for this sample are close in magnitude, and the difference between them is never statistically significant.\n\nIn Table V we present estimates of the same set of models using 40\u201449 year-old men from the 1980 Census. Again, the similarity between the various OLS and TSLS estimates of the return to education is striking. For example, comparing the OLS and TSLS models in columns (7) and (8)\u2014which include quadratic age and several covariates\u2014the OLS estimate of the return to education is 0.063 (with a \u00a2-ratio of 210.7), and the TSLS estimate of the return to education is 0.060 (with a -ratio of 2).\n\nTable VI presents estimates for 30-39-year-old men (born 1940-1949) using data from the 1980 Census.

Second, the TSLS models are identified by the variation in education across each quarter of birth in each year, between the first quarter and the rest of the year. whereas the Wald estimate is identified by the overall difference in education\n\n17. Because the OLS estimates of the return to education are extremely precise with these large samples, the standard error of the T'SLS estimates is approximately equal to the standard error of the difference between the OLS and TSLS estimates. The TSLS standard error can thus be used to perform an approximate Hausman [1978] specification test.\n\nTHE EFFECTS OF COMPULSORY SCHOOL ATTENDANCE\n\nTABLE IV\n\nOLS anDp TSLS ESTIMATES OF THE RETURN TO EDUCATION FOR MEN BORN 1920-1929: 1970 CENsUS*",

For exam- ple, one could compare the return to education using variation in education between first and fourth quarter births in 1940, between second and third quarter births in 1940, between second and third quarter births in 1941, etc. The x* statistics presented at the bottom of Tables IV, V, and VI test the hypothesis that the various combinations of instruments yield the same estimate of the return to education. This statistic is calculated as the sample size times the R from a regression of the residuals from the TSLS equation on the exogenous variables and instruments [Newey, 1985]. In spite of the huge sample sizes, the overidentifying restrictions are not rejected in the models in Tables IV and V. The models in Table VI lead to a rejection of the overidentifying restrictions, but the models that include a quadratic age trend are close to not rejecting at the 0.01 level.",

This exercise suggests that the main impact of compulsory schooling is on the log weekly wage, and not on weeks worked. For example, when the log of weeks worked is used as the dependent variable in column (6) of Table VII instead of the log weekly wage, the TSLS estimate is 0.016 with a standard error of 0.008. This is within sampling variance of the OLS estimate, which is 0.008 with a standard error of 0.0002.\n\nB. Allowing the Seasonal Pattern in Education to Vary by State of Birth\n\nAlthough most schools admit students born in the beginning of the year at an older age, school start age policy varies across states and across school districts within many states. Therefore, because compulsory schooling constrains some students to remain in school until their birthday, the relationship between education",

Freeing up the instruments by state of birth and including 50 state-of-birth dummies in the wage equation results in approxi- mately a 40 percent reduction in the standard errors of the TSLS estimates. Furthermore, in the specifications in each of the col- umns in Table VII, the estimated return to education in the TSLS model is slightly greater than the corresponding TSLS estimate in Table V, whereas in each of the OLS models the return is slightly smaller in Table VII than in Table V. As a consequence, the difference between the TSLS and OLS estimates is of greater significance. For example, the TSLS estimate in column (6) of Table VII is 0.083 with a standard error of 0.010, and the OLS estimate is 0.063 with a standard error of 0.0003: the TSLS estimate is nearly 30 percent greater than the OLS estimate.",

    "text": "To further explore this issue, we computed OLS estimates of the return to education for men with nine to twelve years of schooling, and found little difference between estimates for this subsample and the full sample. For example, the OLS estimate of the return to education for men born 1930-1939 with nine to twelve years of education is 0.059, compared with 0.063 for the full sample in column (5) of Table V. We also note that we obtained similar TSLS estimates of the return to education when our extracts were restricted to men with a high school degree or less.\n\nC. Estimates for Black Men\n\nUsing data on men born in the first half of the twentieth century, many researchers find that OLS estimates of the return to education are lower for black men than for white men (e.g., Welch [1973] ). At least part of the lower return to education for black men appears to be due to the lower quality schools that were provided for black students in these cohorts (see Card and Krueger [1992b] ). If schools attended by black students were of inferior quality, then we would expect to find a lower return to compulsory schooling for black workers than for white workers.",

    "text": "In Table VIII we provide estimates of the return to education for the sample of black men born 1930-1939. As in Table VII the excluded instruments for education are interactions between quar- ter-of-birth and year-of-birth dummies, and interactions between quarter-of-birth and state-of-birth dummies. Both the OLS and TSLS estimates indicate that the return to education is lower for black men than for the entire male population. In view of the lower quality of schools attended by black students, this finding provides some additional support for the plausibility of the TSLS estimates. Moreover, the TSLS estimates for this subsample are within sampling variance of the OLS estimates. Unlike the estimates for the entire sample, however, the TSLS estimates are slightly less than the OLS estimates.\n\nIII.

From Section I it would seem that season of birth is related to education because of compulsory schooling requirements. However, for the TSLS esti- mates to be consistent, it must also be the case that season of birth is uncorrelated with the residual in the earnings equation (p). In other words, if season of birth influences earnings for reasons other than compulsory schooling, our approach is called into question. Although we believe the evidence in Section I establishes that season of birth influences education exclusively because of compulsory schooling, it is useful to consider the impact of other possible effects of season of birth.",

Furthermore, much of the past literature fails to adequately control for the effects of age.\u201d Nevertheless, the previous research indicates that there might be a relationship between age at school entry and academic performance.

Assume, for the moment, that children born in the beginning of the year are better students because they are older than their classmates. Men born in the first quarter of the year would therefore have greater unob- served ability for a given level of schooling. However, men born in the first quarter also have less education, probably due to the dominant effect of compulsory education laws. Assuming that this unobserved ability is rewarded in the labor market, any estimator of the return to education that is identified by variations in education due to season of birth would be biased downward.\n\nSecond, we note that if season of birth were related to the socioeconomic status of children\u2019s parents, one might expect to find a connection between season of birth and education.

This point is also made by Lewis and Griffin [1981] in the context of season-of-birth effects in diagnoses of schizophrenia.\n\n1008\n\nQUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS\n\nthe case, season of birth would be an unsatisfactory instrumental variable for our purposes. Lam and Miron [1987], however, present a variety of evidence suggesting that season of birth is unrelated to the socioeconomic status (and other characteristics) of parents. For example, they find that the seasonal pattern in births is virtually identical for illegitimate births and legitimate births. In addition, they find that the seasonal pattern of birth is similar across urban and rural families, across regions of the United States that have diverse economic and cultural conditions, and within countries before and after dramatic economic transitions.",

There is no obvious reason why the psychological or socioeconomic explana- tions for the seasonal pattern of education would have less force for the 1940s cohort than for the 1920s cohort. On the other hand, if season of birth influences education because of compulsory school- ing, one would expect to find a smaller effect for individuals in more recent cohorts, who are likely to be less constrained by the compulsory schooling requirement.",

Because individuals born in the beginning of the year usually start school at an older age than that of their classmates, they are allowed to drop out of school after attaining less education. Our exploration of the relationship between quarter of birth and educational attainment suggests that season of birth has a small effect on the level of education men ultimately attain. To support the contention that this is a consequence of compulsory schooling laws, we have assembled evidence showing that some students leave school as soon as they attain the legal dropout age, and that season of birth has no effect on postsecondary years of schooling.",

    "text": "Our results provide support for the view that students who are compelled to attend school longer by compulsory schooling laws earn higher wages as a result of their extra schooling. Moreover, we find that compulsory schooling laws are effective in compelling some students to attend school. Do these results mean that compulsory schooling laws are necessarily beneficial? A complete answer to this question would require additional research on the social and private costs of compulsory school attendance. For example, compulsory attendance may have the benefit of reducing crime rates. And they may impose a social cost because students who are compelled to attend school may interfere with the learning of other students.\n\nAPPENDIX 1: DATA",

Department of Commerce, 1975]. Our extract for 1960 is drawn from the 1 percent Public Use Sample. The sample used consists of boys and girls born in 1944. The extract of the 1970 Census used in Table II is drawn from the two 1 percent State files (the State samples of the 5 percent Form and of the 15 percent Form) because these files identify state of residence. The sample consists of boys and girls born in 1954. Finally, the sample of boys and girls born in 1964 in the 1980 Census, 5 percent sample are used as well. In each of the three samples, individuals with allocated age or enrollment were excluded.\n\nAPPENDIX 2: COMPULSORY SCHOOL ATTENDANCE AGE BY STATE\n\nState 1960 1970 1980 Notes 1 Alabama 16 16 16 2 Alaska 16 16 16 4 Arizona 16 16 16 5 Arkansas 16 16 15 6 California 16 16 16 8 Colorado 16 16 16 9 Connecticut 16 16 16 10 Delaware 16 16 16 11D.C. 16 16 16 12 Florida 16 16 16 13 Georgia 16 16 16 15 Hawaii 16 18 18 Increased to 18 midyear, 1970 16 Idaho 16 16 16 17 Illinois 16 16 16",
